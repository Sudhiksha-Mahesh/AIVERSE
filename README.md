# 🚦AI-powered annotation tool for ADAS training
# 🚦 AI-Powered Object Detection for Urban Traffic Scenes

This project demonstrates a deep learning-based object detection system that can recognize and label vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic lights in real-world urban traffic scenes. Developed using Python and hosted in Google Colab, this tool allows for object detection on single images, image directories, or video files with a clean and intuitive interface.

## 📌 Project Overview

With the rise of smart cities and autonomous transportation, monitoring and interpreting traffic conditions efficiently is more crucial than ever. This project leverages pre-trained object detection models like **YOLOv5** or **SSD** on the **COCO dataset** to identify:

- 🚗 Cars
- 🚌 Buses
- 🧍 Pedestrians
- 🚦 Traffic lights

## 📁 Features

- ✅ Detect objects in images, folders of images, or video files
- 🎛️ Adjustable confidence threshold slider
- 🎥 Real-time preview and result display
- 💻 Interactive sidebar UI with options
- 📦 Built on state-of-the-art object detection architectures
